* IoC: Cleanup and refactor of service-builder. Extract logic to separate file(s)

* Claims Validation: Implement validation for created-date within cover-period

* Auditing + Queue:
 - Consider moving QueueService and queue to separate project
 - Move models and Auditer-"proxy" to its relevant folders/project
 - Expose audit-endpoint to fetch all audits (could be scoped to admin-only)
 - Verify/update queue-service-logic to make sure it works as intended

* Tests (more tests)
 - Add integration-tests (explicit "unit" tests on proxy-methods)
 - Service-tests (checking that auditing is performed, and any exception handling)
 - Controller-tests (i.e verifying exception-handling and validation responses)
 - Cleanup of ClaimsControllerTests.cs (it is currently wrong, should not fail if serealization fails within the test itselfs)

* Permium-calculation: Utils-method can be refactored for even greater readabilitys
